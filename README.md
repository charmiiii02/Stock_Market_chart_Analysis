# Stock_Market_chart_Analysis

Stock market analysis is becoming more and more popular as people try their hand at trading stocks. Chart pattern analysis plays a significant role in technical analysis. When data is plotted, a natural pattern usually emerges and repeats over a period of time. These patterns can help us understand the market and make predictions about trends.

In this project, we will use Python to analyze stock market charts and detect common chart patterns. Specifically, we will focus on detecting the Head and Shoulders pattern.

#Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to install the following dependencies:

#### pandas
#### numpy
#### scipy

# A Step-By-Step Guide On How To Install And Run The Program:

Install Python on your computer if it is not already installed. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to install the program.

Create a new Python environment by typing the following command in the command prompt or terminal:

>> python -m venv env

This will create a new directory called env that contains the Python environment.

Activate the Python environment by typing the following command:

>> source env/bin/activate

On Windows, use the following command instead:

>> env\Scripts\activate

Install the required Python packages by typing the following command:

>> pip install pandas numpy scipy

This will install the packages needed to run the program.

Download the files algo_1.py save in the same directory.

Open the algo_1.py file in a text editor and modify the train_ratio and test_ratio variables if desired. These variables determine the ratio of the dataset that is used for training and testing.
Run the program by typing the following command:

>> python algo_1.py 

This will run the program and generate a plot of the predicted and actual values.

When you are finished using the program, deactivate the Python environment by typing the following command:

>> deactivate 

This will return you to your normal command prompt or terminal session.
