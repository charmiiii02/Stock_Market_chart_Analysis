# Stock_Market_chart_Analysis

Stock market analysis is becoming more and more popular as people try their hand at trading stocks. Chart pattern analysis plays a significant role in technical analysis. When data is plotted, a natural pattern usually emerges and repeats over a period of time. These patterns can help us understand the market and make predictions about trends.

In this project, we will use Python to analyze stock market charts and detect common chart patterns. Specifically, we will focus on detecting the Head and Shoulders pattern.

#Getting Started
